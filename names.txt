The universe is fading, most of it already gone
The player must work to reclaim/regrow/regenerate the universe
The universe is constantly fading. Anything the player removes from the univers (kills/destroys) contributes to it's fade
The more cycles the player completes, the more the universe is regrown and can be explored.
eventually, teh universe will reach a critical mass, and will reset/renew. At this point the game can be considered complete.
