The Walking Shadow
Oh What Great Heart
All Riven
All Given
This, A Never Ending Riddle
Where the Stars Touch the Sky
Yet, Now She Sees the Dragon's Dogma
Land and Skies, and Seas Yearn
My Mother, My Flame
Mildewed and Smoldering
The Dangers of a Second Guessing
Not Yet Blessed
A White Rose Withering
A Black Rose Burning
A Song of Me; A Song in Need
A Verse for Me; A Verse in Need
A Couragous Symphony
The Rest is Silence
Once, So Long Ago
Poet Without a Rhyme
Dance a Jig at the Funeral
Deep Silence Between the Notes
A Fleeting Moment on an Arc
An Angels Kiss, Now Fallen
The Killing Hand
Revelation Warms a Touch
Extended a View to Yesterday
Sipping His Poison, the Raven Sings
Mercy Dealt With a Losing Hand
The Unbroken Spirit, Obscured and Disquiet
The Silence Within You
Empty Deeds Impress No Longer
Singing on the Shoulders of an Angel
The Advent of May
Heaven Never Touched Earthly Face
In your Arms, Sweet Death Should Dwell
For Whom the Prey Weeps
Kiss under the Waning Moon
Beneath a Blackened Summer Sky
Chasing Water From the Sky
Everything, a Wish for the Night
Songmaker's Cry
Someone Like Him
As My Conscience Slips Away
Our Sacrificed Sons
Far Beyond What I Could See
A Brief Wakening
Looking Outward, Reaching In
Each Darkest Fire
Impulsive Designs
